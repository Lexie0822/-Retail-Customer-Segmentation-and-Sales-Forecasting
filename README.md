# Customer Segmentation and Sales Forecasting for a UK-based Gift Company

## Table of Contents
1. Data Understanding and Cleaning (`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (`EDA.ipynb`)
3. Feature Engineering (`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`)
4. Customer Segmentation (`Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`)
5. Sales Forecasting Strategy (`Sales_Forecasting.ipynb`)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Start by running `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` for data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. Proceed with `EDA.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis.
3. Execute `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` for customer segmentation based on K-means clustering.
4. Finally, run `Sales_Forecasting.ipynb` to understand the sales forecasting strategy (actual modeling is not available due to environmental constraints).

## Note
- Due to environmental constraints, some plots and models could not be executed but the approach has been clearly outlined.
